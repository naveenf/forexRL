  Output Visibility Timeline

  Step 1: Project Structure Setup

  Output: ✅ Immediate
  - Directory structure visible
  - Config files readable
  - python -c "import yaml; print('Setup OK')" works

  Step 2: Data Manager Implementation

  Output: ✅ Immediate & Testable
  # You can test immediately:
  from src.data_manager import DataManager
  dm = DataManager()
  data = dm.load_sample_data()  # Will show forex data
  print(data.head())  # See actual OHLC + indicators
  dm.plot_indicators()  # Visual charts of RSI, MACD, etc.
  What you'll see: Real forex data with calculated technical indicators, plots, data validation results

  Step 3: Environment Implementation

  Output: ✅ Immediate & Interactive
  # Test the trading environment:
  from src.environment import MultiPairForexEnv
  env = MultiPairForexEnv(data, pairs=['EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY'])

  # Run simulation with random actions
  obs = env.reset()
  for i in range(100):
      action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random trade
      obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
      print(f"Step {i}: Action={action}, Reward={reward:.2f}, Balance=${info['balance']:.2f}")
  What you'll see: Live trading simulation, balance changes, trade executions, reward calculations

  Step 4: Training Script Preparation

  Output: ✅ Testable Locally (before Colab)
  # Test training setup locally (small scale):
  from training.train_ppo import setup_training
  model, env = setup_training()
  model.learn(total_timesteps=1000)  # Quick test
  print("Training pipeline works!")
  What you'll see: PPO model initialization, short training run, validation that everything connects

  Step 5: Full Training (Google Colab)

  Output: ✅ Rich Visual Feedback
  - TensorBoard graphs: Reward progression, loss curves
  - Real-time logs: Episode rewards, win rates
  - Training progress: "Step 50000/500000, ETA: 8.5 hours"
  - Evaluation results: Every 10k steps shows performance metrics

  Key Compilation Milestones

  ✅ After Step 2: Runnable data pipeline

  python -m src.data_manager --test  # Shows forex data + indicators

  ✅ After Step 3: Interactive trading simulator

  python -m src.environment --demo  # Live trading simulation

  ✅ After Step 4: End-to-end training test

  python -m training.train_ppo --test-mode  # Quick validation run

  ✅ After Step 5: Trained model ready for inference

  python -m src.inference_engine --model trained_model.zip  # Real predictions

  What You'll Actually See

  Step 2 Output Example:
  Loading EUR/USD data: ✓ 350,000 candles (2015-2025)
  Calculating indicators: ✓ RSI, MACD, BBands, ATR
  Data validation: ✓ No missing values, valid ranges
  Sample data preview:
                     open    high     low   close    RSI   MACD
  2024-01-01 00:00  1.1045  1.1052  1.1041  1.1048   45.2  0.0012

  Step 3 Output Example:
  Episode 1: Starting balance $10,000
  Step 45: BUY EURUSD at 1.1048, Confidence: 67%
  Step 49: Closed position +$85 profit in 4 candles → REWARD: +500!
  Episode reward: +650, Win rate: 75%
